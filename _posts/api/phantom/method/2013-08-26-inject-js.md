`phantom.injectJs(filename)` {boolean}

Injects external script code from the specified file into the Phantom outer space. If the file cannot be found in the current directory, [`libraryPath`](#phantom-libraryPath) is used for additional look up. This function returns `true` if injection is successful, otherwise it returns `false`.

## Examples

```javascript
var wasSuccessful = phantom.injectJs('lib/utils.js');
```
