The interface with various PhantomJS functionalities is carried out using a new host object named `phantom`, added as a child of the [`window` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window).

Currently most of the functions and properties here are to do with cookies.

For many scripts `phantom.exit()` is the only function from this module that will be needed. If your script just sits there once it has finished this, this was the function call you forgot.

The `args` property allows your script to use commandline parameters.

`injectJS()` is used to bring in and run other JavaScript; this allows you to organize your PhantomJS scripts. [TODO: compare to webpage.injectJS and webpage.includeJS, and explain when you use each.]

If your script is crashing with no information, try setting the `onError` handler. This is where errors go that did not get caught by webpage's `onError` handler.
