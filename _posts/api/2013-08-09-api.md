## phantom Object

The interface with various PhantomJS functionalities is carried out using a new host object named `phantom`, added as a child of the [`window` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window).

## Module: WebPage



## Module: child_process

The child_process module allows you to invoke subprocesses and communicate with them via stdin / stdout / stderr. This is useful for tasks such as printing, sending mail, or invoking scripts or programs written in another language (not Javascript).

## Module: FileSystem

A set of API functions is available to access files and directories, modeled after the [CommonJS Filesystem proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Filesystem).

To start using, you must `require` a reference to the `fs` module:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
```

## Stream Objects

Stream objects are returned from the [fs.open]({{ site.url }}/api/fs/method/open.html) method.

## Module: System



## Module: WebServer

**Stability:** _EXPERIMENTAL_

**Introduced:** PhantomJS 1.4

Using an embedded web server module called [Mongoose](http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/), PhantomJS script can start a web server. This is intended for ease of communication between PhantomJS scripts and the outside world and is _not_ recommended for use as a general production server. There is currently a limit of **10** concurrent requests; any other requests will be queued up.
