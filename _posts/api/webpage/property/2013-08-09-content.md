`content` {string}

This property stores the content of the web page (main frame), enclosed in an HTML/XML element. Setting the property will effectively reload the web page with the new content.

See also `page.plainText` to get the content without any HTML tags.

## Examples

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();
// @TODO: Finish page.content example.
```
