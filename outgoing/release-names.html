        <h2>PhantomJS 1.9 "Sakura"</h2>

<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5030/5607810834_3220056f56_m.jpg" align="right"></p>

<p>Sakura is a spring flower, see Ariya's <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/phantomjs/yM25jtdispo/dXbenqn-mvYJ">email on Mar 23, 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
We do agree that this release should mark the end of the 1.x series.
Going forward, we'll switch to Qt 5 and use the chance to boot the
all-new 2.0. For such a closing release, it just makes sense to pick
something related to the first code name ever given (exercise for the
reader), hence why 1.9 is called "Sakura".

        <h2>PhantomJS 1.8 "Blue Winter Rose"</h2>

<p><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/File:Blue_Roses1.jpg"><img src="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/8/83/Blue_Roses1.jpg" width="225" align="right"></a></p>
<p>The <b>Blue Winter Rose</b> is a flower that grows in the glass gardens of Winterfell.
It's pale blue the color of frost. Also, it's connected to the legend of <b>Bael the Bard</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
    Bael the Bard climbed the Wall.<br/>
    Took the Kingsroad and entered Winterfell.<br/>
    He made himself known as Sygerrik of Skagos, a singer.<br/>
    He sang until midnight for the Lord's pleasure.<br/>
    Impressed by his skills, Lord Brandon Stark asked him what rewarded he wanted.<br/>
    Bael asked for the most beautiful flower in Winterfell's gardens.<br/>
    Blue winter roses were just blooming.<br/>
    Brandon Stark agreed to offer him one.<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>The following morning, the virgin daughter of the lord had disappeared. In her bed was a Blue Winter Rose.</p>

        <h2>PhantomJS 1.7 "Blazing Star"</h2>

<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liatris_spicata_close-up.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Liatris_spicata_close-up.jpg/220px-Liatris_spicata_close-up.jpg" align="right"></a></p>

<p>Blazing Star is an autumn flower. See Ariya's
<a href="http://groups.google.com/d/topic/phantomjs/7jiydz_52cg">email</a> on Sep 22, 2102:</p>

<blockquote>
"Blazing Star" is a mesmerizing and beautiful flower, it is often used
as a symbol representing happiness and satisfaction. Tending these
flowers requires some patience, the reward is however worth all the hassle.

Its beautiful appearance makes it popular among gardeners, don't be
surprised if you are stunned by the florets for hours and hours.
Blazing star is also known to have mild medicinal characteristics.
A fabulous combination of outer beauty and inner beauty I would say.

These days, with almost every web-related test framework gets
connected to PhantomJS in one way or another, presenting these
attractive yet romantic blossoms marking a joyful relationship could
not be a better honor for us.

<h2>PhantomJS 1.6 "Lavender"</h2>

<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Single_lavendar_flower02.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Single_lavendar_flower02.jpg/220px-Single_lavendar_flower02.jpg" align="right"></a> </p>

<p>Lavender is a summer flower. See Ariya's <a href="http://groups.google.com/d/topic/phantomjs/EOKOqdmXcjU">email on June 18, 2012</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
...for this summer  release, I pick the code name "Lavender". This summer flower is not
only beautiful, it is also known for its wonderful scent and soothing
quality, often served as a remedy for anything from sore joints to
insomnia. Well, with the widespread use of PhantomJS in various
testing frameworks since some releases ago, isn't that exactly what
this headless WebKit also brings to many web developers? Helping
people to stay calm, avoid anxiety, and increase their productivity is
surely a decent goal to have!

<h2>PhantomJS 1.5 "Ghost Flower"</h2>

<p>Ghost Flower is a spring flower. See Ariya's <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phantomjs/6pDNT-Epk7E/discussion">email on March 15, 2012</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
...for this spring release, I cast the code name "Ghost Flower". This spring flower is
rather beautiful actually. California, where I now reside, is one of
its native home. In addition, I'm sure you'll notice the significance
of the first word in the name :)

<h2>PhantomJS 1.4 "Glory of the Snow"</h2>

<p><a title="By Hedwig Storch (Own work) [CC-BY-SA-3.0 (www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ADunkle_Sternhyazinthe_2008-3-7a.JPG"><img width="240" alt="Dunkle Sternhyazinthe 2008-3-7a" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Dunkle_Sternhyazinthe_2008-3-7a.JPG/240px-Dunkle_Sternhyazinthe_2008-3-7a.JPG" align="right"></a> </p>

<p>Glory of the Snow is a winter flower. See Ariya's <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phantomjs/5VA1kQH_864/discussion">email on Nov 29, 2011</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Approaching the final month before its very first birthday, I'm sure
we're all very happy to see that PhantomJS gains a lot of tractions
these days. There are reports of people using it with various
JavaScript test frameworks, along with assorted types of continuous
integration systems. The ecosystem grows and lately there seems to be
an increasing amount of projects using PhantomJS as a basis to do
something which was not possible before. In short, it spreads like
wild fire. Thus, it just makes sense for me to cast the winter release
of PhantomJS, i.e. version 1.4, as "Glory of the Snow". It's a winter
flower with beautiful colorful star petals which easily grows and
spreads to almost everywhere.

<h2>PhantomJS 1.3 "Water Lily"</h2>

<p><a title="By Kazuyanagae (Own work) [CC-BY-SA-3.0 (www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nymphaea_japan.jpg"><img width="240" alt="Nymphaea japan" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Nymphaea_japan.jpg/240px-Nymphaea_japan.jpg" align="right"></a></p>

<p>Water Lily is an autumn flower. See Ariya's <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phantomjs/kRz9atKlyWE/discussion">email on June 24, 2011</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
When I started PhantomJS, I never thought it would be this
fascinating. Getting some interests from the integration testing folks
is awesome. In particular, I hope (we're getting there) PhantomJS can
be a nice solution for, among others, Ruby developers. Related to
this, hereby I designate the autumn release of PhantomJS, i.e. version 1.3,
as "Water Lily", an autumn flower considered by many to be the "jewels of the pond".

<h2>PhantomJS 1.2 "Birds of Paradise"</h2>

<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5277/5896075342_9a3118666f_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="bird of paradise" align="right"></p>

<p>Birds of Paradise is a summer flower. See Ariya's <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phantomjs/5MHRKM8IOyU/discussion">email on May 31, 2011</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I feel honored that PhantomJS gains a lot of tractions and used by
many front-end developers. One particular striking example is Twitter.
Now, if I allow to pick a random bird (remember the tweet connection),
that'll be sunbird. In particular because Strelitzia nicolai is
pollinated by the sunbirds.
Strelitzia nicolai is just one species under the genus Strelitzia,
commonly known as the beautiful Birds of Paradise flowers.

<h2>PhantomJS 1.1 "Cherry Blossom"</h2>

<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5030/5607810834_3220056f56_m.jpg" align="right"></p>

<p>Cherry Blossom is a spring flower. See Ariya's <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phantomjs/0LINaH93DpI/discussion">email on Apr 9, 2011</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I would like to have "seasonal" PhantomJS release schedules. Thus,
this month seems to qualify very well for a Spring release of
PhantomJS 1.1. Most likely code name for this release is "Cherry
Blossom" since there are apparently lots of PhantomJS fans in Japan
(search for PhantomJS in Twitter) and with the recent difficult time
they have, paying homage to them is the least we can do."
